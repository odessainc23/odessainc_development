Locally shared objects or “flash cookies” are data files that can be created on your computer by the websites you visit and are a way for websites to store information for later use. Locally stored objects are different than cookies because they are stored in different parts of your computer than cookies.

These third-party providers also may use these technologies to help share information with us, like how you use their website or application. To learn more about the information they collect or receive, review their privacy policies. </p>
            <p>As part of using our Odessa Solution, Odessa’s Customers may submit to Odessa electronic data or information (“Submitted Data”) that constitutes personal information of other individuals.
