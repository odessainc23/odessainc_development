Except as specified in Table A-1 below, Odessa provides such support during Odessa Standard Business Hours. Odessa will provide such support to up to two (2) named support contacts designated by Customer as a primary and backup administrator, who will be knowledgeable in all material aspects of Customer's network and operating environment, and who will have completed and remain current with Odessa’s recommended training for support contacts for the Supported Software. Customer will ensure that its support contacts direct queries and notifications to Odessa’s designated telephone support numbers and email addresses.

						<p>2.2<span class="sub-heading"> Support Response.</span> Odessa will notify Customer of Errors and other material problems detected by Odessa, and will assign all Errors one of four response priorities, dependent upon the problems caused by the Error, and consistent with the Severity Level descriptions below. Odessa will also respond to information and enhancement requests, consistent with the Severity Level 5 description below. The priorities will dictate the timing and nature of the response as specified in Table A-1 below. Response times are calculated from the moment at which Customer's request for support first reaches Odessa's customer support phone lines, or Odessa's customer support email. Priority categories are as follows:</p>
						<p>2.2.1<span class="sub-heading-italic"> Severity Level 1 – Software Down or Unusable:</span> An Error stops the Supported Software from running, or so severely impacts production use of the Supported Software that Customer’s business operations are critically affected and Customer cannot reasonably continue work. </p>

						<p>2.5<span class="sub-heading">Remote Support.</span> Odessa and Customer have agreed that Odessa will provide all Support Services remotely from Odessa’s offices. Customer will provide Odessa with remote access (over a VPN, WebEx or other similar secure access system) to Customer’s testing and production servers on which the Supported Software is installed, to enable Odessa’s provision of Support Services.  It is Customer’s responsibility to provide an environment on which any reported problem can be recreated or captured.  Unless otherwise agreed between the parties, Customer will not provide Odessa with access to or copies of Licensed Program databases containing un-scrubbed or un-obfuscated customer data or Personal Information. Odessa will have no liability for any non-performance of Support Services arising out of any failure of Customer or its suppliers to provide Odessa with access to such servers.</p>
						<p>2.6<span class="sub-heading">On-Site Visits.</span> Without limiting the generality of Section 2.5 above, if Odessa and Customer mutually determine that Odessa may more effectively resolve an Error with an on-site visit to any Customer location, then Customer will pay Odessa for Odessa’s travel, attendance and services on a time and materials basis at Odessa’s then current daily rates, and will reimburse Odessa for Odessa's reasonable travel and living expenses. </p>
						<p>2.7<span class="sub-heading">Customer Cooperation.</span> Customer acknowledges that Odessa may not be able to resolve an Error if Customer does not cooperate with and assist Odessa in resolving the Error (including in replicating the Error, in retrieving and sharing database, workstation, server and log file data relating to the Error, and in providing Odessa with access to Customer's servers, databases and all other aspects of its operating environment as necessary for Odessa to diagnose and resolve the Error). Customer will use deployment automation tools as required by Odessa for deployment and promotion of all Software releases (including Fixes) in all Customer environments. Customer is responsible for obtaining, operating, maintaining and supporting all equipment, services and other software necessary to operate the Software. </p>
						<p>2.8<span class="sub-heading">Software Releases.</span> Odessa will make Software Releases available to Customer if and when they are made generally commercially available by Odessa to Odessa's customers. Odessa may provide Customer with a Maintenance Fix if Customer is experiencing, or in Odessa's sole discretion may experience a Severity Level One or Two situation. Software Releases will constitute "Software" for purposes of the Master Agreement. Odessa will be solely responsible for determining whether derivative works of or improvements to the Software constitute a Software Release or new software programs not covered by the applicable Sales Order or Support Services.</p>
						<p>2.9<span class="sub-heading">Support Obligations Applicable to APIs and Third Party Programs.</span> The following provisions apply only if Customer is acquiring APIs or Third Party Programs from Odessa, and only to the extent the Sales Order specifies that Odessa will provide Support Services for the APIs or the Third Party Programs.</p>
						<p>2.9.1<span class="sub-heading-italic">Support, Error Resolution and Upgrades.</span> Odessa will provide technical support and Error resolution services for the APIs and general release versions of Third Party Programs as part of the Support Services and also will provide, to the extent and subject to the limitations specified below, Software Releases for the APIs and Third Party Programs. </p>
						<p>2.9.2<span class="sub-heading-italic">Odessa Upgrade Compatibility.</span> Odessa will design general release Software Releases of the Odessa Programs to maintain compatibility with APIs and Third Party Programs that qualify as Supported Software, at no additional charge to Customer. With respect to APIs and Third Party Programs that do not qualify as Supported Software, Odessa will charge Customer at Odessa’s then standard rates for developing such compatibility.</p>
						<p>2.9.3<span class="sub-heading-italic">Third Party Product Compatibility.</span> If the suppliers of Supported Software Third Party Programs or the products or services with which Supported Software APIs are designed to interoperate modify such programs, products or services, then Odessa will provide compatibility between the Odessa Programs and the applicable APIs and general release versions of Third Party Programs. Odessa will charge Customer at Odessa’s then standard rates for developing such compatibility for any APIs or Third Party Programs that do not qualify as Supported Software. Customer acknowledges that Odessa requires reasonable advance notice in order to modify and test APIs and Odessa Program Software Releases that are designed to interoperate with new versions of Third Party Programs in order to maintain compatibility, and that Odessa will have no responsibility for any incompatibilities between the APIs or Odessa Program Software Releases and the third party products or services or new versions of Third Party Programs and consequent Errors unless and until Odessa has made its modifications available for general release.</p>
						<p>2.9.4<span class="sub-heading-italic">Operating System Changes.</span> Odessa may, but will not be obligated to, perform the work necessary to obtain compatibility between the APIs and changes in Customer’s operating environment. Odessa will charge Customer for such work at its standard rates.</p>
						<p>2.9.5<span class="sub-heading-italic">Dependence on Third Party Licensors.</span> Odessa does not have access to the source code of, nor rights to modify the Third Party Programs. The Parties each acknowledge that Odessa’s ability to resolve Errors in, and provide new releases of Third Party Programs is dependent upon the applicable Third Party Program supplier. Odessa will nonetheless be solely responsible for monitoring and enforcing the Third Party Program supplier’s support and maintenance obligations under the applicable supply agreement between them.</p>
						<p>2.10<span class="sub-heading">Scope of Support and Software Release Services.</span> Odessa will have no obligation to correct Errors or support queries arising from Customer's misuse or alteration of the Supported Software, failure or fluctuation of electrical power, maintenance of the Supported Software by anyone other than Odessa or Odessa's authorized representatives, Customer's combining or merging Supported Software with any hardware or software not identified as compatible by Odessa, use of the Supported Software other than in accordance with the Documentation or the provisions of this Agreement, or Customer’s provision to Odessa of incorrect configuration directions or other information. Odessa will have no obligation to correct Errors or support Software or PSA Deliverables except with respect to the Supported Software. Odessa will be obligated to comply with its response times and resolution commitments in this Agreement only with respect to Customer's production use of the Supported Software: if Odessa, in its sole discretion, elects to address Errors or other problems with the Software outside the scope of this Exhibit (e.g., bugs occurring in non-production use, or bugs in old versions that Odessa is no longer obligated to support), then Odessa will handle such Errors on a reasonable efforts basis, and may charge for its services at its then current applicable rates. The Support Services exclude any configuration of any Software or PSA Deliverables. Odessa's provision of support services and Software Releases is conditioned on Customer being current on its Support Services Fees payments for all of the Supported Software.</p>
						<p>2.10.1<span class="sub-heading-italic">Customer Responsibilities.</span> Except to the extent specified in a supplemental services agreement between Odessa and Customer, Customer will be responsible for each of the items described in this Section 2.10.1. This list of responsibilities is not intended to be exhaustive, but addresses primary issues for purposes of clarification. Odessa will not be obligated to resolve problems (including Errors) arising from Customer’s non-conformance with this Section 2.10.1. Odessa may, at Customer’s request, diagnose, resolve, or participate in resolution of such problems, but may charge Customer for its work at Odessa’s then standard rates.</p>
						<p>(a) <span class="inner-sub-heading">Systems and Network Administration.</span> Customer is responsible for proper maintenance of all hardware, operating systems, and other support software that run beneath the Supported Software, including: disk space maintenance; log file maintenance; backups, clustering, load balancing, application server, administration, user administration; patch administration; routing, security, firewall, and other types of network administration. To the extent that Odessa accepts responsibility for Supported Software performance, that responsibility ends at the point where the Supported Software makes information available to its applicable web server. Odessa cannot, and has no obligation to control Supported Software performance through Customer’s network infrastructure and the subsequent “internet cloud.”<br>
						</p>
						<p>(b) <span class="inner-sub-heading">Database Administration.</span> Customer is responsible for proper maintenance of all hardware and software associated with the database required by the Supported Software (typically a Microsoft SQL Server application), including disk space and database file maintenance, database index maintenance, user administration, and all other activities described by the database administration documentation and as required for proper database performance and function.<br>
						</p>
						<p>(c) <span class="inner-sub-heading">Capacity Planning.</span> Customer is responsible for monitoring load on the systems and application and for projecting, planning, and executing any expansion in the number or type of application servers, database servers, report servers, document servers, and web servers required to maintain system performance at acceptable levels. In any event, Customer will ensure that its systems and their performance are at least as  good as those of Customer’s systems as documented in Odessa’s QA exit report for the implementation project, or for any subsequent performance testing or capacity planning professional services engagements performed by Odessa under the Professional Services Agreement (the <span class="highlight">“Baseline Criteria”</span>). If Customer wishes to materially change its systems or application configurations, or increase loads in excess of the Baseline Criteria, and if such change or increase causes performance issues in the Supported Software which are not the result of Errors inherent in the Software then, if Odessa and Customer agree that Odessa will provide Support Services for any such performance issues, Odessa may charge Customer for its services at its then current applicable rates, or Customer and Odessa may enter into a capacity planning project under a new statement of work to the Professional Services Agreement.<br>
						</p>
						<p>(d) <span class="inner-sub-heading">Software Administration.</span> Customer is responsible for performing normal administration of the Software as described in the applicable Documentation and in any training provided by or on behalf of Odessa, including: adding and deleting users, monitoring and cleaning up of “todo” items, adding and deleting customers, workflow maintenance, and running reports.<br>
						</p>
						<p>(e) <span class="inner-sub-heading">Security.</span> Customer is responsible for performing system and network administration including virus protection activities, and for designing, implementing, and managing security procedures and security infrastructure to ensure the security of the information and capabilities within the system on which Customer operates the Software.</p>
						<p>2.10.2<span class="sub-heading-italic">Project Customizations.</span> Except to the extent specified in a statement of work to the Professional Services Agreement or in a Sales Order or Sales Order addendum (for example, if Customer is purchasing an enhanced support package that specifically includes such support), Odessa is not obligated to:</p>
						<p>(a)	provide Error resolution for any PSA Deliverables that do not qualify as Supported Software, nor to provide new or updated versions of Project Customizations or of Configurations; nor</p>
						<p>(b)	provide or ensure compatibility between any Software Releases and any version of any Project Customizations or Configurations.</p>
						<p>Odessa may provide error resolution, upgrade and compatibility services for Project Customizations or Configurations if requested by Customer, but will do so under the Professional Services Agreement, and will charge Customer for its services at Odessa’s then standard rates.</p>
						<p>2.11<span class="sub-heading">Modification of Support Services.</span> Odessa may modify the nature and extent of the Support Services upon not less than thirty (30) days prior written notice to Customer; provided, however, that no modification will be effective without Customer’s prior written consent if it materially adversely affects Customer’s rights under this Support Exhibit.</p>
						<h4>Section 3.	Termination; Reinstatement</h4>
						<p>3.1<span class="sub-heading">Termination.</span> </p>
						<p>3.1.1<span class="sub-heading-italic">Termination of Sales Order.</span> Support Services will terminate upon any termination or expiration of the License Term.</p>
						<p>3.1.2<span class="sub-heading-italic">Termination by Customer.</span> Following expiration of any minimum term specified in the Sales Order, Customer may terminate the Support Services for all (but not some) of the Supported Software for convenience, at any time upon notice to Odessa. </p>
						<p>3.1.3<span class="sub-heading-italic">Termination by Odessa – Product Sunset.</span> Following expiration of any minimum term specified in the Sales Order, Odessa may terminate the Support Services for any Supported Software on not less than one (1) year’s prior written notice to Customer, should Odessa determine in its sole discretion that it is no longer economically feasible for Odessa to provide such Support Services.</p>
						<p>3.2<span class="sub-heading">Refunds.</span> Odessa will refund any Support Services Fees prepaid by Customer for the unutilized portion of the then current Support Term if: (i) Customer terminated the Sales Order as a result of an uncured material breach by Odessa, in accordance with Section 8.4 (Termination For Cause) of the Master Agreement; (ii) if Odessa terminated the Sales Order in accordance with Section 7.2 (Odessa’s Mitigation Rights For Third Party Infringement Claims) of the Master Agreement; or (iii) if Odessa terminated the Support Services pursuant to Section 3.1.3 (Product Sunset) above. No refund will be payable, nor will Customer be entitled to relief from Support Services Fees payable with respect to any minimum Support Services subscription term, in any other circumstances. Odessa will pay Customer any applicable refund within thirty (30) days of such termination.</p>
						<p>3.3<span class="sub-heading">Reinstatement.</span> If Customer has cancelled any Support Services under a Sales Order, and Customer subsequently wants to reinstate Support Services, then Customer will pay Odessa a reinstatement fee equal to fifty percent (50%) of the Annual Support Fees last paid or payable by Customer, together with the Support Fees that would have been payable for the intervening period between cancellation of Support Services and reinstatement. The new Support Term will commence on the day that Odessa first recommences Support Services. Customer will pay Odessa the reinstatement fee and the Annual Support Fees for the new Support Term within thirty (30) days of receipt of Odessa’s invoice.</p>

						<p>2.1.2<span class="sub-heading-italic">Backup.</span> Odessa will perform periodic backups of compatible Customer Data stored on the System, as specified in this Section 2.1.2. Odessa will perform a daily incremental backup of Customer Data entered into the System since the last backup seven (7) days per week. Odessa will perform a full backup of Customer Data stored on the System at least once per week. Odessa will retain each full backup copy within the Odessa Environment Technology for fourteen (14) days, then transmit  a digital copy to a geographically separate data center. If Customer requires individual document restoration due to Customer user error, then Odessa will provide assistance, as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt of Customer’s written request. Odessa will provide such assistance under a Statement of Work pursuant to the Professional Services Agreement, at the applicable rates then in effect between the parties or, if none, at Odessa’s then current rates.</p>
						<p>2.2<span class="sub-heading">Technical Support.</span> Odessa will provide Customer with telephone and email support regarding use of the Supported Software and resolution of Defects in accordance with Table A 1 below. Except as specified in Table A-1 below, Odessa provides such support during Odessa Standard Business Hours. Odessa will provide such support to up to two (2) named support contacts designated by Customer as a primary and backup administrator, who will (a) be knowledgeable in all material aspects of Customer's network and operating environment, (b) be sufficiently technically skilled to perform investigation and testing without significant support from Odessa, and (c) have completed and remain current with Odessa’s recommended training for support contacts for the Supported Software. Such support contacts will perform such problem investigation and testing of Defect resolutions as Odessa may reasonably request. Customer will ensure that its support contacts direct queries and notifications to Odessa’s designated telephone support numbers and email addresses. Customer will notify Odessa of its initial support contacts and their email addresses and mobile phone numbers promptly following the License Schedule Effective Date. Customer may change the contacts by written notice to Odessa. Customer may not contact Infrastructure Provider for Support Services.</p>
						<p>2.3<span class="sub-heading">Environment Access and Responsibilities.</span> Odessa’s and Customer’s access rights and respective responsibilities for non-production and production environments are addressed in the License Schedule.</p>
						<h4>Section 3.	Defect Procedures</h4>
						<p>3.1<span class="sub-heading">Response.</span> Odessa will assign all Defects one of four response priorities, dependent upon the problems caused by the Defect. Odessa may re-assign prioritization levels assigned by Customer in Odessa’s trouble ticketing system, to reflect the problem descriptions below. The priorities will dictate the timing and nature of the response as specified in Table A 1 below. Priority categories are as follows:</p>
						<p>3.1.1<span class="sub-heading-italic">Severity Level 1 – System Unavailable; Software Down or Unusable:</span> As a result of the occurrence of a Defect, the Supported Software is not Available; or a Defect stops the Supported Software from running, or so severely impacts production use of the Supported Software that Customer’s business operations are critically affected and Customer cannot reasonably continue work.</p>
						<p>3.1.2<span class="sub-heading-italic">Severity Level 2 – Performance Impaired - No Workaround; Software Functionality Disabled:</span> As a result of the occurrence of a Defect, the Supported Software is Available but its performance is materially adversely affected, and no Workaround exists for the affected performance; or a Defect causes a major functional area of the Supported Software to be unavailable with no reasonable Workaround and there is a serious impact on Customer’s productivity, but production use of the Supported Software is continuing and Customer can reasonably continue work using the Supported Software.</p>
						<p>3.1.3<span class="sub-heading-italic">Severity Level 3 – Functionality Disabled - Workaround Available; Degraded Operations:</span> As a result of the occurrence of a Defect, the Supported Software is Available but its performance is materially adversely affected, but a Workaround exists for the affected performance; or a Defect exists which causes a major functional area of the Supported Software to be unavailable or to function other than as specified in the applicable Documentation but a Workaround exists; or a Defect causes less significant functions of the Supported Software to be unavailable or to function other than as specified in the applicable Documentation, with no reasonable Workaround; or a Defect which causes performance slowdowns in the Supported Software, but where Customer can still reasonably continue to work using the Supported Software.</p>
						<p>3.1.4<span class="sub-heading-italic">Severity Level 4 – Minor Defect:</span> A Defect which does not affect essential use of the Supported Software, but which represents a deviation from the applicable Documentation. Examples of such Defects include: screen formatting or placement; minor spelling errors; color Defects, and sorting Defects.</p>
						<p>3.1.5<span class="sub-heading-italic">Severity Level 5 - Information/Enhancement Request:</span> Customer requests information, an enhancement, or documentation clarification regarding the Supported Software but there is no material adverse impact on the operation of the Supported Software.</p>

						<p>3.4<span class="sub-heading">Customer Cooperation.</span> Customer will promptly notify Odessa of Defects it encounters, and provide such information, data and other assistance as Odessa may reasonably request to resolve such Defects. </p>
						<p>3.5<span class="sub-heading">Scope of Support and Software Release Services.</span> Odessa will have no obligation to correct Defects or support queries arising from Customer's misuse or alteration of the System, maintenance of the System by anyone other than Odessa, Infrastructure Provider, or their authorized representatives, use of the System other than in accordance with the Documentation or the provisions of this Agreement, or Customer’s provision to Odessa of incompatible data, or incorrect configuration directions or other information. Odessa will have no obligation to correct Defects or support Software or PSA Deliverables except with respect to the Supported Software. Odessa will be obligated to comply with its response times and resolution commitments in this Agreement only with respect to Customer's production use of the System: if Odessa, in its sole discretion, elects to address Defects occurring in non-production use of the System, then Odessa will handle such Defects on a reasonable efforts basis. Except to the extent specified in a statement of work to the Professional Services Agreement or in a License Schedule or License Schedule addendum (for example, if Customer is purchasing an enhanced support package that specifically includes such support), Odessa is not obligated to (a) provide Defect resolution for any PSA Deliverables that do not qualify as Supported Software, nor to provide new or updated versions of Non-Core Software Deliverables (collectively and individually, “Excluded PSA Deliverables”); nor (b) provide or ensure compatibility between any Software Releases and any version of any Excluded PSA Deliverables. Odessa may provide error resolution, upgrade and compatibility services for Excluded PSA Deliverables if requested by Customer, but will do so under the Professional Services Agreement, and will charge Customer for its services at Odessa’s then standard rates or such other rates as may be agreed in writing between Odessa and Customer. Odessa is not required to configure any Software or PSA Deliverables as part of the Support Services.</p>
						<h4>Section 4.	Service Levels</h4>
						<p>4.1<span class="sub-heading">Service Level Standards.</span> During the Subscription Term, Odessa will maintain the following service levels for the System (collectively, the “Service Levels”), failing which it will pay the “Service Level Credits” described below:</p>
						<p>4.1.1<span class="sub-heading-italic">Availability Service Level.</span> The average Availability of the System in each month of a rolling three (3) calendar month period will be at least those percentages specified in the “Availability Service Level” table set forth in the Subscription Schedule, excluding any system maintenance or Force Majeure Events (as defined below) that result in Downtime, as measured and monitored from Odessa’s facilities (the “<span class="highlight">Availability Service Level</span>”).</p>
						<p>4.1.2<span class="sub-heading-italic">Determination of Availability.</span> Availability will be calculated on a monthly basis using the following formula:  (Actual Availability divided by Total Scheduled Availability) multiplied by 100.  The following terms apply with respect to the calculation of Availability: </p>
						<p><span class="highlight">“Actual Availability”</span> means Total Scheduled Availability minus Downtime, in minutes. </p>
						<p><span class="highlight">Downtime</span> does not include any Downtime due to Scheduled Maintenance, Emergency Maintenance, or to any Defect arising out of a Force Majeure Event. </p>
						<p><span class="highlight">“Force Majeure Event”</span> means any failure or delay caused by or the result of causes beyond the reasonable control of Odessa or its service providers that could not have been avoided or corrected through the exercise of reasonable diligence, including acts of God, fire, flood, hurricane or other natural catastrophe, internet access or related problems beyond the demarcation point of Infrastructure Provider’s facilities, denial of service attacks, terrorist actions, laws, orders, regulations, directions or actions of governmental authorities having jurisdiction over the subject matter hereof, or any civil or military authority, national emergency, insurrection, riot or war, or other similar occurrence. </p>
						<p><span class="highlight">“Total Scheduled Availability”</span> means 7 days per week, 24 hours per day.</p>
						<p>4.2<span class="sub-heading">Reporting.</span> During the Subscription Term, Odessa will, upon Customer’s request, provide monthly reports to Customer that include Odessa’s performance with respect to the Service Levels. </p>
						<p>4.3<span class="sub-heading">Service Level Credits.</span> If Odessa fails to meet any of the Service Levels, Customer will be eligible to request a credit calculated as follows (the “<span class="highlight">Service Level Credits</span>”): </p>
						<p>4.3.1<span class="sub-heading-italic">SLA Penalty for Service Availability Service Level Failure.</span> If Odessa fails to meet the Availability Service Level during any given month and Customer requests a Service Level Credit, then Odessa will provide Customer with a Service Level Credit equal to the percentage of the Monthly Subscription Fees for the month in which the service level failure occurred, corresponding to the System Availability Level specified in the “Availability Service Level Credits” table in the License Schedule. Each Service Level Credit will be paid by Odessa to Customer by way of a credit on the next invoice submitted by Odessa to Customer. If any credits are unutilized upon expiration or termination of the Subscription Term, than Odessa will apply such credits to any other Fees or expenses payable by Customer to Odessa. If there are no such other Fees or expenses, then Odessa will pay Customer the credit amount.</p>
						<p>4.4.<span class="sub-heading">Limited Remedy.</span> The rights to Service Level Credits are Customer's sole and exclusive remedy for any failure by Odessa related to the System. The maximum total credit for failure to meet the Service Levels for any given month will not exceed 15% of the Monthly Subscription Fees. Service Level Credits that would be available but for these limitation will not be carried forward to future months.</p>
						<p>4.5<span class="sub-heading">Scope.</span> The Service Level commitments will automatically abate to the extent that the System has been maintained, configured, damaged, abused, modified, or combined with other software or equipment (not designated by Odessa as compatible) by persons other than Odessa's authorized employees or representatives, or other than at Odessa's express direction. The Service Level commitments apply only to production use of the System, and do not apply to any non-production instances/environments of the System, such as staging and testing environments or instances. The Service Level commitments do not apply to any Defect caused by a Defect in any Third Party Programs (provided that Odessa will nonetheless remain obligated to resolve any such Defect resulting in Downtime as a Severity Level One Defect). Customer is not entitled to any Service Level Credit if it is in breach of the Agreement (including Customer’s payment obligations) at the time of the occurrence of the event giving rise to the credit.  To receive a Service Level Credit, Customer must contact its Odessa account manager within ten (10) days of the occurrence of the event giving rise to the credit.  The Service Levels and related credit rights are conditioned upon Customer’s permitting Infrastructure Provider to have full logical access to the configuration of the Odessa Environment.</p>
						<h4>Section 5.	Upgrades</h4>
						<p>Odessa will make Software Releases available to Customer if and when they are made generally commercially available by Odessa to Odessa's customers. Odessa will install Software Releases and upgrade the Software when determined by Odessa in its discretion, but after reasonable consultation with Customer. Odessa will use commercially reasonable efforts to perform such installations and upgrades during Maintenance Windows. Odessa may provide Customer with a Maintenance Fix if Customer is experiencing, or in Odessa's sole discretion may experience a Severity Level One or Two situation. Software Releases will constitute "Software" for purposes of the Master Agreement. Odessa will be solely responsible for determining whether derivative works of or improvements to the Software constitute a Software Release or new software programs not covered by the applicable License Schedule or Support Services.</p>
						<h4>Section 6.	APIs and Third Party Programs</h4>
						<p>6.1<span class="sub-heading">Support Obligations Applicable to APIs and Third Party Programs.</span> The following provisions apply only if Customer is acquiring APIs or Third Party Programs from Odessa, and only to the extent the License Schedule specifies that Odessa will provide Support Services for the APIs or the Third Party Programs.</p>
						<p>6.1.1<span class="sub-heading-italic">Support, Defect Resolution and Upgrades.</span> Odessa will provide technical support and Defect resolution services for the APIs and general release versions of Third Party Programs as part of the Support Services and also will provide, to the extent and subject to the limitations specified below, Software Releases for the APIs and Third Party Programs. </p>
						<p>6.1.2<span class="sub-heading-italic">Odessa Upgrade Compatibility.</span> Odessa will design general release Software Releases of the Odessa Programs to maintain compatibility with APIs and Third Party Programs that qualify as Core Software, at no additional charge to Customer. With respect to APIs and Third Party Programs that do not qualify as Core Software, Odessa will charge Customer at Odessa’s then standard rates for developing such compatibility.</p>
						<p>6.1.3<span class="sub-heading-italic">Third Party Product Compatibility.</span> If the suppliers of Core Software Third Party Programs or the products or services with which Core Software APIs are designed to interoperate modify such programs, products or services, then Odessa will provide compatibility between the Odessa Programs and the applicable APIs and general release versions of Third Party Programs. Odessa will charge Customer at Odessa’s then standard rates for developing such compatibility for any APIs or Third Party Programs that do not qualify as Core Software. Customer acknowledges that Odessa requires reasonable advance notice in order to modify and test APIs and Software Releases that are designed to interoperate with new versions of Third Party Programs in order to maintain compatibility, and that Odessa will have no responsibility for any incompatibilities between the APIs or Software Releases and the third party products or services or new versions of Third Party Programs and consequent Defects unless and until Odessa has made its modifications available for general release.</p>
						<p>6.1.4<span class="sub-heading-italic">Dependence on Third Party Licensors.</span> Odessa does not have access to the source code of, nor rights to modify the Third Party Programs. The Parties each acknowledge that Odessa’s ability to resolve Defects in, and provide new releases of Third Party Programs is dependent upon the applicable Third Party Program supplier. Odessa will nonetheless be solely responsible for monitoring and enforcing the Third Party Program supplier’s support and maintenance obligations under the applicable supply agreement between them.</p>
						<h4>Section 7.	Modification of Support Services</h4>
						<p>Odessa may modify the nature and extent of the Support Services upon not less than thirty (30) days prior written notice to Customer; provided, however, that no modification will be effective without Customer’s prior written consent if it materially adversely affects Customer’s rights under this Support Exhibit.</p>

During any period in which Customer is a current, paid-up subscriber to Support Services, Customer may obtain rights under the Escrow Agreement by executing a “Registration Agreement” with Escrow Agent under the Escrow Agreement, substantially in the form attached as Appendix 2 to the Escrow Agreement. Odessa will execute the Registration Agreement following receipt of notice from Customer to that effect. Customer will compensate Escrow Agent for Escrow Agent’s services under the Escrow Agreement as specified in the Registration Agreement (including costs of its registration and all other subsequent periodic fees attributable to Customer’s registration).</p>
						<p><b>“Source Code”</b> means human-readable computer programming code corresponding to the Software (except to the extent of any third party programs distributed by Odessa for which Odessa does not have rights to distribute source code), together with a description of third party software and product documentation used by Odessa to install and compile the Software, and database schema.</p>
						<p>1.2<span class="sub-heading">Source Code Deposit.</span> If Customer executes and delivers a Registration Agreement under the Escrow Agreement, then Odessa will deposit a copy of the Source Code with the Escrow Agent within 120 days of the later to occur of the date on which (a) Odessa first delivers an executable version of the Software to Customer, or (b) Customer executes and delivers the Registration Agreement to Odessa and the Escrow Agent. Throughout the term of each Registration Agreement, so long as Customer is a current, paid-up subscriber to Support Services, Odessa will keep the Source Code deposited at the Escrow Agent complete and current by delivering an update or replacement copy of the Source Code to the Escrow Agent within 12 months of the last deposit, and in any event within 60 days of delivery of a final version of a <b>“Significant Upgrade”</b> of the executable version of the Software to Customer. For these purposes, “Significant Upgrade” means a version of the Software with a change in the y component of the Software’s x.y.z version number, or any other version that Odessa and Customer agree in writing should be treated as a Significant Upgrade for purposes of this Agreement. </p>
						<p>1.3<span class="sub-heading">Source Code Release.</span> The “Release Events” for purposes of the Registration Agreement under the Escrow Agreement (pursuant to which the Escrow Agent will release and deliver the Source Code to Customer) are the occurrence of any one of the following circumstances during any period in which Customer is a current, paid-up subscriber to Support Services with Odessa and remains a party to an effective Registration Agreement.</p>

						<p>1.4<span class="sub-heading">Source Code License. </span>If Source Code is delivered to Customer (either directly by Odessa or by the Escrow Agent in fulfillment of its obligations under the Escrow Agreement), then Odessa hereby grants to Customer for the applicable License Term a non-exclusive, non-transferable (except pursuant to Section 12.11) license, without right to sub-license, to (i) reproduce the Source Code for the version of the Software then in use by Customer and to distribute such copies within Customer, solely to extent necessary for Customer to exercise its support and modification rights under this Source Code license, (ii) modify such Source Code, solely to the extent necessary: to correct Errors; to enable compliance with changes in applicable law; and to enable interoperation with changes in Customer’s network environment; but not to create independent software programs from any portions of such Source Code; and (iii) to compile such Source Code and any proper modifications thereof into executable files, and run such executable files to the extent permitted for Software under this Agreement. Source Code is and will remain Confidential Information of Odessa. Customer will treat the source code with the same degree of care and security as it treats its own commercially valuable source code, and at least a reasonable standard of care.

Qlik Products are the technology of “Qlik®”. Qlik Products contain license management software and require license keys for their use.</p>
						<p>2.	Customer has no license or any other right to the Qlik Products on an independent or standalone basis, and may under no circumstances whatsoever use the Qlik Products independently or separated from the LeaseWave Software.

No partial termination of Support Services for the Qlik Products is permitted.</p>
						<p>5.	Customer agrees to (i) comply with all applicable local, state, national and foreign laws and regulations in connection with Customer’s use of the Qlik Products, including those related to data privacy, copyright, export control and the transmission of technical or personal data; and (ii) use reasonable security precautions for providing access to the Qlik Products by its employees or other individuals to whom Customer provides access and to prevent unauthorized access to use of the Qlik Products.

						<p>6.	Individual software components, each of which has its own copyright and its own applicable license conditions (“Third Party Materials”) may be distributed, embedded, or bundled with the Qlik Products.

						<p>7.	Customer shall ensure that (i) any copy of the Qlik Product is produced only in accordance with the terms of the this Agreement and for the Customer’s own benefit, (ii) any such copy is clearly marked subject to copyright and confidentiality restrictions, and (iii) a written list is maintained of the number of copies and place of storage.

						<p>11.	Odessa may provide Customer’s name, address, individual Customer contact names and information to Qlik, for use by Qlik for its due diligence purposes, such as ensuring its compliance with OFAC, FCPA and other applicable laws.</p>
						<p>12.	Customer shall indemnify, defend and hold Qlik and Odessa harmless from any and all damages and reasonable and verifiable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) to the extent incurred by Qlik or Odessa as a result of any third party claim to the extent based on any allegation that any modification or alteration to a Qlik Product or any combination of the Partner Solution and a Qlik Product, made by Customer, infringes any patent, copyright, or trademark, or misappropriates any trade secret of a third party, except to the extent any such infringement or misappropriation arises solely on account of an unmodified Qlik Product. </p>

							<p><i>a.</i> Odessa complies with laws applicable to it and its services.</p>
							<p><i>b.</i> Odessa is entitled to rely upon (among other things) the DMCA safe harbor available to hosting service providers and search engines. Although it is Odessa’s policy to respond to clear notices of alleged copyright infringement, Odessa recommends that you submit a notice pursuant to the DMCA directly to the customer who provided the content. Odessa’s response to these notices may include forwarding the notice to the applicable customer or removing or disabling access to material claimed to be the subject of infringing activity. Odessa maintains policies and procedures to terminate subscribers that would be considered repeat infringers under the DMCA. See 17 U.S.C. 512 available at <a href="http://www.copyright.gov/" target="_blank">http://www.copyright.gov/</a></p>
							<p><i>c.</i> You may submit a DMCA notification to Odessa’s Designated Copyright Agent with the following information in writing (see 17 U.S.C. 512(c)(3) for additional information):</p>
							<div class="inner">
								<p>i.	a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the allegedly infringed copyright;</p>
								<p>ii.	identification of the copyrighted work or works claimed to have been infringed;</p>
								<p>iii.	identification of, and information reasonably sufficient to permit Odessa or the applicable customer to locate, the material that is claimed to be infringing or is the subject of infringing activity;</p>
								<p>iv.	information reasonably sufficient to permit the applicable customer or Odessa to contact you, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address;</p>
								<p>v.	a statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and</p>
								<p>vi.	a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</p>
							</div>
							<p><i>d.</i> Unless it is reasonably apparent to Odessa that the applicable customer has already received a notice of infringement from you regarding a particular content, Odessa will forward all the information you provide in your notice, including your contact information, to the applicable customer. Odessa’s Designated Copyright Agent to receive notifications of claimed copyright infringement is our Legal Department, Odessa Technologies, Inc., 50 S 16th Street, Suite 1900, Philadelphia, PA 19102, email: <a href="emailto:abuse@odessainc.com">abuse@odessainc.com.</a></p>
