            <p>2.1 <span class="sub-heading"> Technical Support.</span> Odessa will provide Customer with telephone and email support regarding use of the Supported Software and resolution of Errors in accordance with Table A 1 below. Except as specified in Table A-1 below, Odessa provides such support during Odessa Standard Business Hours. Odessa will provide such support to up to two (2) named support contacts designated by Customer as a primary and backup administrator, who will be knowledgeable in all material aspects of Customer's network and operating environment, and who will have completed and remain current with Odessa’s recommended training for support contacts for the Supported Software. Customer will ensure that its support contacts direct queries and notifications to Odessa’s designated telephone support numbers and email addresses. Customer will notify Odessa of its initial support contacts promptly following the Sales Order Effective Date. Customer may change the contacts by written notice to Odessa. </p>
            <p>2.2 <span class="sub-heading"> Support Response.</span> Odessa will notify Customer of Errors and other material problems detected by Odessa, and will assign all Errors one of four response priorities, dependent upon the problems caused by the Error, and consistent with the Severity Level descriptions below. Odessa will also respond to information and enhancement requests, consistent with the Severity Level 5 description below. The priorities will dictate the timing and nature of the response as specified in Table A-1 below. Response times are calculated from the moment at which Customer's request for support first reaches Odessa's customer support phone lines, or Odessa's customer support email. Priority categories are as follows: </p>
            <p>2.2.1 <span class="sub-heading-italic"> Severity Level 1 – Software Down or Unusable:</span> An Error stops the Supported Software from running, or so severely impacts production use of the Supported Software that Customer’s business operations are critically affected and Customer cannot reasonably continue work. </p>
            <p>2.2.2 <span class="sub-heading-italic"> Severity Level 2 – Functionality Disabled:</span> An Error causes a major functional area of the Supported Software to be unavailable with no reasonable Workaround and there is a serious impact on Customer’s productivity, but production use of the Supported Software is continuing and Customer can reasonably continue work using the Supported Software. </p>
            <p>2.2.3 <span class="sub-heading-italic"> Severity Level 3 – Degraded Operations:</span> An Error which causes a major functional area of the Supported Software to be unavailable or to function other than as specified in the applicable Documentation but a Workaround exists; or an Error causes less significant functions of the Supported Software to be unavailable or to function other than as specified in the applicable Documentation, with no reasonable Workaround; or an Error which causes performance slowdowns in the Supported Software, but where Customer can still reasonably continue to work using the Supported Software. </p>
            <p>2.2.4 <span class="sub-heading-italic"> Severity Level 4 – Minor Error:</span> An Error which does not affect essential use of the Supported Software, but which represents a deviation from the applicable Documentation. Examples of such Errors include: screen formatting or placement; minor spelling errors; color Errors, and sorting Errors. </p>
            <p>2.2.5 <span class="sub-heading-italic"> Severity Level 5 - Information/Enhancement Request:</span> Customer requests information, an enhancement, or documentation clarification regarding the Supported Software but there is no material adverse impact on the operation of the Supported Software. </p>

            <p>2.5 <span class="sub-heading">Remote Support.</span> Odessa and Customer have agreed that Odessa will provide all Support Services remotely from Odessa’s offices. Customer will provide Odessa with remote access (over a VPN, WebEx or other similar secure access system) to Customer’s testing and production servers on which the Supported Software is installed, to enable Odessa’s provision of Support Services. It is Customer’s responsibility to provide an environment on which any reported problem can be recreated or captured. Unless otherwise agreed between the parties, Customer will not provide Odessa with access to or copies of Licensed Program databases containing un-scrubbed or un-obfuscated customer data or Personal Information. Odessa will have no liability for any non-performance of Support Services arising out of any failure of Customer or its suppliers to provide Odessa with access to such servers. </p>
            <p>2.6 <span class="sub-heading">On-Site Visits.</span> Without limiting the generality of Section 2.5 above, if Odessa and Customer mutually determine that Odessa may more effectively resolve an Error with an on-site visit to any Customer location, then Customer will pay Odessa for Odessa’s travel, attendance and services on a time and materials basis at Odessa’s then current daily rates, and will reimburse Odessa for Odessa's reasonable travel and living expenses. </p>
            <p>2.7 <span class="sub-heading">Customer Cooperation.</span> Customer acknowledges that Odessa may not be able to resolve an Error if Customer does not cooperate with and assist Odessa in resolving the Error (including in replicating the Error, in retrieving and sharing database, workstation, server and log file data relating to the Error, and in providing Odessa with access to Customer's servers, databases and all other aspects of its operating environment as necessary for Odessa to diagnose and resolve the Error). Customer will use deployment automation tools as required by Odessa for deployment and promotion of all Software releases (including Fixes) in all Customer environments. Customer is responsible for obtaining, operating, maintaining and supporting all equipment, services and other software necessary to operate the Software. </p>
            <p>2.8 <span class="sub-heading">Software Releases.</span> Odessa will make Software Releases available to Customer if and when they are made generally commercially available by Odessa to Odessa's customers. Odessa may provide Customer with a Maintenance Fix if Customer is experiencing, or in Odessa's sole discretion may experience a Severity Level One or Two situation. Software Releases will constitute "Software" for purposes of the Master Agreement. Odessa will be solely responsible for determining whether derivative works of or improvements to the Software constitute a Software Release or new software programs not covered by the applicable Sales Order or Support Services. </p>
            <p>2.9 <span class="sub-heading">Support Obligations Applicable to APIs and Third Party Programs.</span> The following provisions apply only if Customer is acquiring APIs or Third Party Programs from Odessa, and only to the extent the Sales Order specifies that Odessa will provide Support Services for the APIs or the Third Party Programs. </p>
            <p>2.9.1 <span class="sub-heading-italic">Support, Error Resolution and Upgrades.</span> Odessa will provide technical support and Error resolution services for the APIs and general release versions of Third Party Programs as part of the Support Services and also will provide, to the extent and subject to the limitations specified below, Software Releases for the APIs and Third Party Programs. </p>
            <p>2.9.2 <span class="sub-heading-italic">Odessa Upgrade Compatibility.</span> Odessa will design general release Software Releases of the Odessa Programs to maintain compatibility with APIs and Third Party Programs that qualify as Supported Software, at no additional charge to Customer. With respect to APIs and Third Party Programs that do not qualify as Supported Software, Odessa will charge Customer at Odessa’s then standard rates for developing such compatibility. </p>
            <p>2.9.3 <span class="sub-heading-italic">Third Party Product Compatibility.</span> If the suppliers of Supported Software Third Party Programs or the products or services with which Supported Software APIs are designed to interoperate modify such programs, products or services, then Odessa will provide compatibility between the Odessa Programs and the applicable APIs and general release versions of Third Party Programs. Odessa will charge Customer at Odessa’s then standard rates for developing such compatibility for any APIs or Third Party Programs that do not qualify as Supported Software. Customer acknowledges that Odessa requires reasonable advance notice in order to modify and test APIs and Odessa Program Software Releases that are designed to interoperate with new versions of Third Party Programs in order to maintain compatibility, and that Odessa will have no responsibility for any incompatibilities between the APIs or Odessa Program Software Releases and the third party products or services or new versions of Third Party Programs and consequent Errors unless and until Odessa has made its modifications available for general release. </p>
            <p>2.9.4 <span class="sub-heading-italic">Operating System Changes.</span> Odessa may, but will not be obligated to, perform the work necessary to obtain compatibility between the APIs and changes in Customer’s operating environment. Odessa will charge Customer for such work at its standard rates. </p>
            <p>2.9.5 <span class="sub-heading-italic">Dependence on Third Party Licensors.</span> Odessa does not have access to the source code of, nor rights to modify the Third Party Programs. The Parties each acknowledge that Odessa’s ability to resolve Errors in, and provide new releases of Third Party Programs is dependent upon the applicable Third Party Program supplier. Odessa will nonetheless be solely responsible for monitoring and enforcing the Third Party Program supplier’s support and maintenance obligations under the applicable supply agreement between them. </p>
            <p>2.10 <span class="sub-heading">Scope of Support and Software Release Services.</span> Odessa will have no obligation to correct Errors or support queries arising from Customer's misuse or alteration of the Supported Software, failure or fluctuation of electrical power, maintenance of the Supported Software by anyone other than Odessa or Odessa's authorized representatives, Customer's combining or merging Supported Software with any hardware or software not identified as compatible by Odessa, use of the Supported Software other than in accordance with the Documentation or the provisions of this Agreement, or Customer’s provision to Odessa of incorrect configuration directions or other information. Odessa will have no obligation to correct Errors or support Software or PSA Deliverables except with respect to the Supported Software. Odessa will be obligated to comply with its response times and resolution commitments in this Agreement only with respect to Customer's production use of the Supported Software: if Odessa, in its sole discretion, elects to address Errors or other problems with the Software outside the scope of this Exhibit (e.g., bugs occurring in non-production use, or bugs in old versions that Odessa is no longer obligated to support), then Odessa will handle such Errors on a reasonable efforts basis, and may charge for its services at its then current applicable rates. The Support Services exclude any configuration of any Software or PSA Deliverables. Odessa's provision of support services and Software Releases is conditioned on Customer being current on its Support Services Fees payments for all of the Supported Software. </p>
            <p>2.10.1 <span class="sub-heading-italic">Customer Responsibilities.</span> Except to the extent specified in a supplemental services agreement between Odessa and Customer, Customer will be responsible for each of the items described in this Section 2.10.1. This list of responsibilities is not intended to be exhaustive, but addresses primary issues for purposes of clarification. Odessa will not be obligated to resolve problems (including Errors) arising from Customer’s non-conformance with this Section 2.10.1. Odessa may, at Customer’s request, diagnose, resolve, or participate in resolution of such problems, but may charge Customer for its work at Odessa’s then standard rates. </p>
            <p>(a) <span class="inner-sub-heading">Systems and Network Administration.</span> Customer is responsible for proper maintenance of all hardware, operating systems, and other support software that run beneath the Supported Software, including: disk space maintenance; log file maintenance; backups, clustering, load balancing, application server, administration, user administration; patch administration; routing, security, firewall, and other types of network administration. To the extent that Odessa accepts responsibility for Supported Software performance, that responsibility ends at the point where the Supported Software makes information available to its applicable web server. Odessa cannot, and has no obligation to control Supported Software performance through Customer’s network infrastructure and the subsequent “internet cloud.” <br>
            </p>
            <p>(b) <span class="inner-sub-heading">Database Administration.</span> Customer is responsible for proper maintenance of all hardware and software associated with the database required by the Supported Software (typically a Microsoft SQL Server application), including disk space and database file maintenance, database index maintenance, user administration, and all other activities described by the database administration documentation and as required for proper database performance and function. <br>
            </p>
            <p>(c) <span class="inner-sub-heading">Capacity Planning.</span> Customer is responsible for monitoring load on the systems and application and for projecting, planning, and executing any expansion in the number or type of application servers, database servers, report servers, document servers, and web servers required to maintain system performance at acceptable levels. In any event, Customer will ensure that its systems and their performance are at least as good as those of Customer’s systems as documented in Odessa’s QA exit report for the implementation project, or for any subsequent performance testing or capacity planning professional services engagements performed by Odessa under the Professional Services Agreement (the <span class="highlight">“Baseline Criteria”</span>).

The priorities will dictate the timing and nature of the response as specified in Table A 1 below. Priority categories are as follows:</p><p>3.1.1<span class="sub-heading-italic">Severity Level 1 – System Unavailable; Software Down or Unusable:</span> As a result of the occurrence of a Defect, the Supported Software is not Available; or a Defect stops the Supported Software from running, or so severely impacts production use of the Supported Software that Customer’s business operations are critically affected and Customer cannot reasonably continue work.</p><p>3.1.2<span class="sub-heading-italic">Severity Level 2 – Performance Impaired - No Workaround; Software Functionality Disabled:</span> As a result of the occurrence of a Defect, the Supported Software is Available but its performance is materially adversely affected, and no Workaround exists for the affected performance; or a Defect causes a major functional area of the Supported Software to be unavailable with no reasonable Workaround and there is a serious impact on Customer’s productivity, but production use of the Supported Software is continuing and Customer can reasonably continue work using the Supported Software.</p><p>3.1.3<span class="sub-heading-italic">Severity Level 3 – Functionality Disabled - Workaround Available; Degraded Operations:</span> As a result of the occurrence of a Defect, the Supported Software is Available but its performance is materially adversely affected, but a Workaround exists for the affected performance; or a Defect exists which causes a major functional area of the Supported Software to be unavailable or to function other than as specified in the applicable Documentation but a Workaround exists; or a Defect causes less significant functions of the Supported Software to be unavailable or to function other than as specified in the applicable Documentation, with no reasonable Workaround; or a Defect which causes performance slowdowns in the Supported Software, but where Customer can still reasonably continue to work using the Supported Software.</p><p>3.1.4<span class="sub-heading-italic">Severity Level 4 – Minor Defect:</span> A Defect which does not affect essential use of the Supported Software, but which represents a deviation from the applicable Documentation. Examples of such Defects include: screen formatting or placement; minor spelling errors; color Defects, and sorting Defects.</p><p>3.1.5<span class="sub-heading-italic">Severity Level 5 - Information/Enhancement Request:</span> Customer requests information, an enhancement, or documentation clarification regarding the Supported Software but there is no material adverse impact on the operation of the Supported Software.</p><div class="table-holder"><table class="big-table"><thead><tr><th>Priority</th><th>Coverage</th><th>Response Time</th><th>Reaction Time</th><th>Resolution Procedures</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Severity Level One</td><td>Odessa Standard Business Hours</td><td>Within 2 business hours</td><td>Within 4 business hours</td><td>Odessa will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide a Workaround or a Fix as soon as reasonably practicable, and will dedicate necessary resources (including development engineers or their equivalents) to resolve the Error.

Odessa will have no obligation to correct Defects or support Software or PSA Deliverables except with respect to the Supported Software. Odessa will be obligated to comply with its response times and resolution commitments in this Agreement only with respect to Customer's production use of the System: if Odessa, in its sole discretion, elects to address Defects occurring in non-production use of the System, then Odessa will handle such Defects on a reasonable efforts basis. Except to the extent specified in a statement of work to the Professional Services Agreement or in a License Schedule or License Schedule addendum (for example, if Customer is purchasing an enhanced support package that specifically includes such support), Odessa is not obligated to (a) provide Defect resolution for any PSA Deliverables that do not qualify as Supported Software, nor to provide new or updated versions of Non-Core Software Deliverables (collectively and individually, “Excluded PSA Deliverables”); nor (b) provide or ensure compatibility between any Software Releases and any version of any Excluded PSA Deliverables. Odessa may provide error resolution, upgrade and compatibility services for Excluded PSA Deliverables if requested by Customer, but will do so under the Professional Services Agreement, and will charge Customer for its services at Odessa’s then standard rates or such other rates as may be agreed in writing between Odessa and Customer. Odessa is not required to configure any Software or PSA Deliverables as part of the Support Services.</p><h4>Section 4.	Service Levels</h4><p>4.1<span class="sub-heading">Service Level Standards.</span> During the Subscription Term, Odessa will maintain the following service levels for the System (collectively, the “Service Levels”), failing which it will pay the “Service Level Credits” described below:</p><p>4.1.1<span class="sub-heading-italic">Availability Service Level.</span> The average Availability of the System in each month of a rolling three (3) calendar month period will be at least those percentages specified in the “Availability Service Level” table set forth in the Subscription Schedule, excluding any system maintenance or Force Majeure Events (as defined below) that result in Downtime, as measured and monitored from Odessa’s facilities (the “<span class="highlight">Availability Service Level</span>”).</p><p>4.1.2<span class="sub-heading-italic">Determination of Availability.</span> Availability will be calculated on a monthly basis using the following formula:  (Actual Availability divided by Total Scheduled Availability) multiplied by 100.  The following terms apply with respect to the calculation of Availability: </p><p><span class="highlight">“Actual Availability”</span> means Total Scheduled Availability minus Downtime, in minutes. </p><p><span class="highlight">Downtime</span> does not include any Downtime due to Scheduled Maintenance, Emergency Maintenance, or to any Defect arising out of a Force Majeure Event. </p><p><span class="highlight">“Force Majeure Event”</span> means any failure or delay caused by or the result of causes beyond the reasonable control of Odessa or its service providers that could not have been avoided or corrected through the exercise of reasonable diligence, including acts of God, fire, flood, hurricane or other natural catastrophe, internet access or related problems beyond the demarcation point of Infrastructure Provider’s facilities, denial of service attacks, terrorist actions, laws, orders, regulations, directions or actions of governmental authorities having jurisdiction over the subject matter hereof, or any civil or military authority, national emergency, insurrection, riot or war, or other similar occurrence. </p><p><span class="highlight">“Total Scheduled Availability”</span> means 7 days per week, 24 hours per day.</p><p>4.2<span class="sub-heading">Reporting.</span> During the Subscription Term, Odessa will, upon Customer’s request, provide monthly reports to Customer that include Odessa’s performance with respect to the Service Levels. </p><p>4.3<span class="sub-heading">Service Level Credits.</span> If Odessa fails to meet any of the Service Levels, Customer will be eligible to request a credit calculated as follows (the “<span class="highlight">Service Level Credits</span>”): </p><p>4.3.1<span class="sub-heading-italic">SLA Penalty for Service Availability Service Level Failure.</span> If Odessa fails to meet the Availability Service Level during any given month and Customer requests a Service Level Credit, then Odessa will provide Customer with a Service Level Credit equal to the percentage of the Monthly Subscription Fees for the month in which the service level failure occurred, corresponding to the System Availability Level specified in the “Availability Service Level Credits” table in the License Schedule. Each Service Level Credit will be paid by Odessa to Customer by way of a credit on the next invoice submitted by Odessa to Customer. If any credits are unutilized upon expiration or termination of the Subscription Term, than Odessa will apply such credits to any other Fees or expenses payable by Customer to Odessa. If there are no such other Fees or expenses, then Odessa will pay Customer the credit amount.</p><p>4.4.<span class="sub-heading">Limited Remedy.</span> The rights to Service Level Credits are Customer's sole and exclusive remedy for any failure by Odessa related to the System. The maximum total credit for failure to meet the Service Levels for any given month will not exceed 15% of the Monthly Subscription Fees. Service Level Credits that would be available but for these limitation will not be carried forward to future months.</p><p>4.5<span class="sub-heading">Scope.</span> The Service Level commitments will automatically abate to the extent that the System has been maintained, configured, damaged, abused, modified, or combined with other software or equipment (not designated by Odessa as compatible) by persons other than Odessa's authorized employees or representatives, or other than at Odessa's express direction. The Service Level commitments apply only to production use of the System, and do not apply to any non-production instances/environments of the System, such as staging and testing environments or instances. The Service Level commitments do not apply to any Defect caused by a Defect in any Third Party Programs (provided that Odessa will nonetheless remain obligated to resolve any such Defect resulting in Downtime as a Severity Level One Defect). Customer is not entitled to any Service Level Credit if it is in breach of the Agreement (including Customer’s payment obligations) at the time of the occurrence of the event giving rise to the credit.  To receive a Service Level Credit, Customer must contact its Odessa account manager within ten (10) days of the occurrence of the event giving rise to the credit.  The Service Levels and related credit rights are conditioned upon Customer’s permitting Infrastructure Provider to have full logical access to the configuration of the Odessa Environment.</p><h4>Section 5.	Upgrades</h4><p>Odessa will make Software Releases available to Customer if and when they are made generally commercially available by Odessa to Odessa's customers. Odessa will install Software Releases and upgrade the Software when determined by Odessa in its discretion, but after reasonable consultation with Customer. Odessa will use commercially reasonable efforts to perform such installations and upgrades during Maintenance Windows. Odessa may provide Customer with a Maintenance Fix if Customer is experiencing, or in Odessa's sole discretion may experience a Severity Level One or Two situation. Software Releases will constitute "Software" for purposes of the Master Agreement. Odessa will be solely responsible for determining whether derivative works of or improvements to the Software constitute a Software Release or new software programs not covered by the applicable License Schedule or Support Services.</p><h4>Section 6.	APIs and Third Party Programs</h4><p>6.1<span class="sub-heading">Support Obligations Applicable to APIs and Third Party Programs.</span> The following provisions apply only if Customer is acquiring APIs or Third Party Programs from Odessa, and only to the extent the License Schedule specifies that Odessa will provide Support Services for the APIs or the Third Party Programs.</p><p>6.1.1<span class="sub-heading-italic">Support, Defect Resolution and Upgrades.</span> Odessa will provide technical support and Defect resolution services for the APIs and general release versions of Third Party Programs as part of the Support Services and also will provide, to the extent and subject to the limitations specified below, Software Releases for the APIs and Third Party Programs. </p><p>6.1.2<span class="sub-heading-italic">Odessa Upgrade Compatibility.</span> Odessa will design general release Software Releases of the Odessa Programs to maintain compatibility with APIs and Third Party Programs that qualify as Core Software, at no additional charge to Customer. With respect to APIs and Third Party Programs that do not qualify as Core Software, Odessa will charge Customer at Odessa’s then standard rates for developing such compatibility.</p><p>6.1.3<span class="sub-heading-italic">Third Party Product Compatibility.</span> If the suppliers of Core Software Third Party Programs or the products or services with which Core Software APIs are designed to interoperate modify such programs, products or services, then Odessa will provide compatibility between the Odessa Programs and the applicable APIs and general release versions of Third Party Programs. Odessa will charge Customer at Odessa’s then standard rates for developing such compatibility for any APIs or Third Party Programs that do not qualify as Core Software. Customer acknowledges that Odessa requires reasonable advance notice in order to modify and test APIs and Software Releases that are designed to interoperate with new versions of Third Party Programs in order to maintain compatibility, and that Odessa will have no responsibility for any incompatibilities between the APIs or Software Releases and the third party products or services or new versions of Third Party Programs and consequent Defects unless and until Odessa has made its modifications available for general release.</p><p>6.1.4<span class="sub-heading-italic">Dependence on Third Party Licensors.</span> Odessa does not have access to the source code of, nor rights to modify the Third Party Programs. The Parties each acknowledge that Odessa’s ability to resolve Defects in, and provide new releases of Third Party Programs is dependent upon the applicable Third Party Program supplier. Odessa will nonetheless be solely responsible for monitoring and enforcing the Third Party Program supplier’s support and maintenance obligations under the applicable supply agreement between them.</p><h4>Section 7.	Modification of Support Services</h4><p>Odessa may modify the nature and extent of the Support Services upon not less than thirty (30) days prior written notice to Customer; provided, however, that no modification will be effective without Customer’s prior written consent if it materially adversely affects Customer’s rights under this Support Exhibit.</p> -->

            </p>
            <div class="inner">
              <p>11.1. Provisioning Access. To minimize the risk of data exposure, Odessa follows the principles of least privilege when provisioning system access. Odessa personnel are authorized to access Customer Personal Data based on their job function, role and responsibilities, and such access requires approval of the employee’s manager. Access rights to production environments are reviewed at least semi-annually. An employee’s access to Customer Personal Data is promptly removed upon termination of their employment. Before an Odessa employee is granted access to the production environment, access must be approved by management and the employee is required to complete internal trainings for such access including trainings on the relevant team’s systems. Odessa logs high risk actions and changes in the production environment. Odessa leverages automation to identify any deviation from internal technical standards that could indicate anomalous/unauthorized activity to raise an alert within minutes of a configuration change.</p>
              <p>11.2. Password Controls. Odessa’s current policy for employee password management follows a strict password standard, and as such, our policy is to use longer passwords, with multi-factor authentication but not require frequent changes. The Odessa Solution supports Single Sign On as well as application based custom authentication. In the case when custom authentication mechanism is leveraged, the Odessa solution stores Customer passwords in encrypted form.</p>
            </div>
            <p>12. <span class="sub-heading-italic">Change Management.</span> Odessa has a formal change management process to manage changes to software, applications and system software that will be deployed within the production environment. Change requests are documented using a formal, auditable, system of record. Prior to a high-risk change being made, an assessment is carried out to consider the impact and risk of a requested change, evidence acknowledging applicable testing for the change, approval of deployment into production by appropriate approvers(s) and roll back procedures. A change is reviewed and tested before being deployed to production. </p>
            <p>13. <span class="sub-heading-italic">Encryption. </span>For the Odessa Solution, Odessa’s cloud platform supports TLS 1.2 to encrypt network traffic transmitted between a Customer application and Odessa’s cloud infrastructure. When supported by integrations selected by Customer, Odessa’s cloud platform will also encrypt network traffic between Odessa’s cloud infrastructure and the integration provider. All Customer Personal Data is stored encrypted using 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-256). </p>
            <p>14. <span class="sub-heading-italic">Vulnerability Management.</span> Odessa maintains controls and policies to mitigate the risk from security vulnerabilities in a measurable time frame that balances risk and the business/operational requirements. Odessa uses a third-party tool to conduct vulnerability scans regularly to assess vulnerabilities in Odessa’s cloud infrastructure and corporate systems. Critical software patches are evaluated, tested and applied proactively. </p>
            <p>15. <span class="sub-heading-italic">Penetration Testing.</span> Odessa performs penetration tests and engages independent third-party entities to conduct application-level penetration tests. Results of penetration tests are prioritized, triaged and remediated promptly by Odessa’s engineering team. </p>
            <p>16. <span class="sub-heading-italic">Security Incident Management.</span> Odessa maintains security incident management policies and procedures in accordance with industry standards and best practices. Odessa assesses the threat of all relevant vulnerabilities or security incidents and establishes remediation and mitigation actions for all events. Odessa utilizes Azure platforms and third-party tools to detect, mitigate, and to help prevent Distributed Denial of Odessa Solution (DDoS) attacks. </p>
            <p>17. <span class="sub-heading-italic"> Discovery, Investigation and Notification of a Security Incident.</span> Upon discovery or notification of any Security Incident, Odessa will: </p>
            <div class="inner">
              <p>17.1. promptly investigate such Security Incident;</p>
              <p>17.2. to the extent that is permitted by applicable law, promptly notify Customer.</p>
            </div>
            <p>18. <span class="sub-heading-italic">Resilience and Odessa Solution Continuity. </span>Odessa infrastructure for the Odessa Solution uses a variety of tools and mechanisms to achieve high availability and resiliency. For the Odessa Solution, Odessa’s infrastructure spans multiple fault-independent Azure availability regions. For the Odessa Solution, there are manual or automatic capabilities to re-route and regenerate hosts within Odessa’s infrastructure. Odessa leverages specialized tools that monitor server performance, data, and traffic load capacity within each availability zone.. Odessa will also be notified immediately and have the ability to take prompt action to correct the cause(s) behind these issues. </p>
            <p>19. <span class="sub-heading-italic">Backups and Recovery.</span> Odessa performs regular backups of the Odessa Solution account information, message templates, message logs and other critical data using Azure cloud storage. Backup data are retained redundantly across availability zones and are encrypted in transit and at rest using 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-256) server-side encryption. </p>
