== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I configure the Open Graph plugin? =

There is nothing to configure and there is no admin page. By default, it will use standard WordPress data which can populate the Open Graph.

= I installed OG and ... nothing happens! =

Please be patient, sometimes you need more a day to see results. The reason for this is the cache on Facebook. But check your plugins too and if you use caching plugins, try to do "flush cache" on your site.

You can force FB to refresh OpenGraph data by using this page https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/sharing/. Just go to Sharing Debugger, enter your URL and hit the button "Scrap Again".

= What is OpenGraph? =

The [Open Graph protocol][] enables any web page to become a rich object in a social graph.  Most notably, this allows for these pages to be used with Facebook's [Like Button][] and [Graph API][].

The Open Graph plugin inserts the Open Graph metadata into the page head section and provides filters for other plugins and themes to override this data, or to provide additional Open Graph data.

= What plugin add for all types of content? =

* og:locale - site locale
* og:site_name - blog title
* og:title - post/page/archive/tag/... title
* og:url - the post/page permalink
* og:type - "article" for single content and "website" for all others
* og:description - site description
* og:site_name - site name

= What plugin add for single content? =

All above and more:

* og:image: From a specific custom field of the post/page, or if not set from the post/page featured/thumbnail image, or if it doesn't exist from the first image in the post content, or if it doesn't exist from the first image on the post media gallery, or if it doesn't exist from the default image defined in the options menu. The same image chosen here will be used in the enclosure and media:content of the RSS feed.
* og:video - add links to YouTube movies.
* article:author - author of post link
* article:published_time - date of first article publication
* article:modified_time - date of last article modification
* article:tag - tags used in the post
* twitter:card - summary
* twitter:title - the same line as og:title
* twitter:description - the same as og:description
* twitter:image - the same as og:image
* twitter:player - the same as og:video
* og:see_also - Pinterest related if you use the supported "related posts" plugin.

= What plugin should I add for a single WooCommerce product? =

All above and more:

* og:price:amount - price amount
* og:price:currency - price currency
* og:availability - stock status

= How plugin get video data? =

The plugin grabs data from the content, and if it contains a YouTube URL, it tries to get a movie thumbnail and use it in og:image.

If the post contains YouTube or Vimeo links, this plugin saves it as a post meta video thumbnail link and adds it to og:image as a post thumbnail.

= If I need to change some values? =

You can use the [Simple SEO Improvements](https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-seo-improvements/) plugin, which is integrated with OG, to:

- set a default image
- set facebook app_id
- set twitter id

***Experimental***

You can use not supported meta tags:

- `og:logo` - to turn on use `add_filter( 'allow_og_logo', '__return_true' )`.

***I need more!***

Rich filter implementation allows you to change almost every output of this plugin, but this is for technicians: Learn more on the [OG Plugin Documentation Site](http://og.iworks.pl/).
